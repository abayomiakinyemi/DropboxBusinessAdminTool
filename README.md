## Notes

The Admin toolkit is a showcase of the Dropbox Business and Dropbox Core API's. It should be seen as an example of what is possible rather than an end to end solution (frankly it only scratches the surface of API capabilites). If you are a Dropbox Business or Enterprise customer please talk to your Dropbox representative about ideas for custom solutions for your Dropbox team. The custom solution development team are able to assist with advisory or full solution work to help you leverage Dropbox as a platform in your business.
